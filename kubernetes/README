Before running the script you have to configure your network settings first to fit the number of nodes in the cluster.
example:
hostnamecli set-hostname master-node
sudo echo "192.168.1.15 master-node.domain master-node" >> /etc/hosts
sudo echo "192.168.1.16 worker1-node.domain worker1-node" >> /etc/hosts

After configuring the network please run:
sudo yum install dos2unix -y
sudo dos2unix kubeinstall.sh

This will make sure the script are in the right file format (unix).
In order to make sure of it please run:
sudo vim kubeinstall.sh
<Press Esacpe> 
:set ff?
This should give you the current file format.

note: make sure the file has the correct permissions as well.
if you're not sure use:
sudo chmod +755 kubeinstall.sh
